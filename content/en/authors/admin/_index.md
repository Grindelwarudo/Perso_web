Hello there, I'm Firas Hammami. I'm currently completing my PhD in Bioinformatics and Genomics at Aix-Marseille Université under the supervision of Elisabeth Remy (Institut de Mathématiques de Marseille, I2M) and Pierre Mandin (Laboratoire de Chimie Bactérienne, LCB).

I'm interested in the mathematical modelling approach (especially the logic formalism) and its application on biological systems, like the regulation of the Iron Sulfur Cluster biogenesis in the bacterium *Escherichia coli*. The mathematical modelling approach allows me to understand better the complex regulations involved in biological processes, which i'm fond of!

On this website, you will see that I got passionnate about two more things: teaching and making videos. By the way, I was a founder of a collaboration for Bioinfuse (a french contest for the popularization of Bioinformatics), which won the 2017 edition.
